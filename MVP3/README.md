A web application, in which the user can chose a section from a map.

A 3D terrain is generated from the section.

By turning physical knobs the user can manipulate the terrain over time, eg. coloring it based on height (height influences the speed by which it gets colored).

The progress can be reset.

The user can chose a new map section (resetting the progress).
