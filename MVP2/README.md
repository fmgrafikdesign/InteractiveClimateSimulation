# MVP1
A web application in which the user can manipulate a graphical object on his screen over time in 3 ways by turning 3 physical knobs.

Install with `npm install`, then run with `npm start`
  
and open in your browser via `http://localhost:3000/`

Uses midi notes 93, 95 and 96 (Last three white notes on the piano on the right side). If you do not have a physical midi device or arduino unit to test, you can use VMPK in combination with the LoopBe1 virtual midi driver.
